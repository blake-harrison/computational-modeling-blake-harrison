    "# Unit 02 Project -- ODEs and Curve Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this \"mini project\" is to demonstrate that you can model realistic projectile motion, including drag and Magnus effect for example, and that you can fit a mathematical function to data and use the curve-fit parameters, as needed, in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- clearly define the model that you are investigating.\n",
    "- use LaTeX to format mathematical equations in your narrative.\n",
    "- investigate changing parameters or initial conditions in your model.\n",
    "- validate your model by testing parameters or initial conditions for known outcomes.\n",
    "- use functions judiciously so you can rerun your model with different parameters or initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "The mini-project should be of sufficient quality to post to github in your portfolio of work that can be shown to a potential employer.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should have the following sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose/Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the purpose of the notebook. What are you modeling? What are you investigating? What did you find?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the \"model\"? What are the relevant ODEs and assumptions in your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not describe your code, unless your description is important and useful to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "What leads you to believe your simulation correctly models the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results/Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Cite your sources. If your program is largely based on another program, describe your unique contributions.\n",

    "**Narrative** | There is very little narrative. Background information is not present or lacks detail. There is no story woven with the code. Mathematical markup is not used. No citations are included. | There is a narrative, but significant parts are missing. The writing does not flow. Sections headings are sparse. Mathematical markup is poor or insufficient. More and better citations are needed. | There is flow, and a clear storyline. Section headings are used to provide an outline. Mathematical markup is used correctly and sufficiently to display mathematics. Citations are sufficient in number and quality.\n",
    "**Code** | Code is missing or is not functional. Nothing is done to demonstrate that the code is operating correctly. Code is difficult to read. Results are missing or seriously incomplete. Visualization is not included. Units are inconsistent or incorrect. Algorithm is implemented incorrectly or the wrong algorithm chosen. There is significant error. | Code is mostly correct and the implementation or algorithm is a good method to use. Visualization is present, but titles and axes labels need improvement or visualization can be improved. Code is understandable and somewhat commented. Units are mostly consistent and correct.| The code runs flawlessly and is well-organized. The code is easy to read and understand. Units are indicated, consistent, and correct. Visualization is excellent. Techniques and algorithms are well-chosen and correctly implemented. Results are clear and understandable.\n",
    "**Difficulty** | The difficulty level is far beneath what one is capable of | The difficulty level is beneath what one is capable of. | The difficulty is well-matched to one's ablity.\n",

    "## Project Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "If 3D visualization helps, use VPython. But choose 3D visualization, only if it helps you tell the story you want to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the angle that gives maximum range for a baseball with a certain linear speed (like 110 mph) and backspin (like 1800 rpm). Then, change the angular speed and find the angle for maximum range again. See what combination of angle and angular speed leads to maximum range, assuming only backspin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve our model for Mike Trout's homerun by taking into account wind and temperature (which affects air density). Test your new model with other homeruns by Trout. Does it more accurately predict the range of the homerun compared to our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Model a curveball pitch using real data (from [baseballsavant.mlb.com](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Model the motion of a golf ball, and reproduce Figure 3.17 of *Computational Modeling and Visualization of Physical Systems* by Jay Wang.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit data to a model rocket engine (for thrust vs. time) and use the function in a model of the rocket's motion. Predict its altitude. Here is an example. I can provide data for various engines.\n",

    "![c6-5-2.JPG](c6-5-2.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Model projectiles under water, including buoyant force. For example, model the motion of a bubble or a plastic, air-filled projectile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop your own project idea, like a \"tank wars\" game (also called *Artillery* in early versions) with wind, drag, and Magnus effect. For fun, put it on Mars with realistic air density and gravitational field for Mars.\n",
