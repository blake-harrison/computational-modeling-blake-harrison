Visualization is not included. Units are inconsistent or incorrect. Algorithm is implemented incorrectly or the wrong algorithm chosen. There is significant error. | Code is mostly correct and the implementation or algorithm is a good method to use. Visualization is present, but titles and axes labels need improvement or visualization can be improved. Code is understandable and somewhat commented.

    "- The writing in the Preface can be improved. For example, in the first sentence, \"...basically taking chunks of code out of the program\" is vague. What \"program\"? And what does \"basically\" mean in this context? It's too colloquial. Does the phrase \"there are a bunch of code cells that aren't intened to actually be run\" mean I shouldn't run these cells? When you don't want someone to run a cell, make it a markdown cells instead of code cells? Use a triple tic in markdown, shown below, along with the language like `python` or `javascript` to format code blocks:\n",

    "- In Jupyter, I suggest putting `import` statements in their own cell. At least for VPython, this really matters. The first time I ran your program (without running any other cells), Jupyter showed the cell was running, but there was no scene. When I stopped the kernel (using the stop button in the toolbar) and ran the cell again, the scene appeared. Putting the import statement in its own cell will fix this. This is obviously a peculiarity to iPython (interactive Python) upon which Jupyter is based.\n",
