    "The full program can be found in the last cell. All you need to do is run that cell by itself, and everything should work. The rest of the code cells are just for explanation purposes.  \n",

Originally, this was two for loops (the second looping over the rows variable that I eventually removed), but that made every box the same color.

It increments for every iteration of the loop by the size of each box, stacking them next to eachother. Similarly the y-position starts at 0 (the center of the boundary walls) and increments up. Because I used multiple statements to generate boxes of different colors, the iteration for the y-direction is hard-coded in.\n",
