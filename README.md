# computational-modeling-blake-harrison
A collection of several projects showcasing several principles of physics.

Each project contains a jupyter notebook containing a description of the project, the underlying physical principles, and the results of the project.
For more information (and to run each individual project), please read the jupyter notebooks included. They will walk through the physics concepts behind and the visualizations of the each project in an easy-to-understand manner.

## Semester Project - Baseball Pitch Visualization
This project provides a visualization of baseball pitches thrown in Major League Baseball games. It uses data provided by MLB's new pitch tracking software to creature a model of each pitch, by taking in factors such as starting velocity, spin axis, and rotational velocity of the baseball. 

## Unit 00 Project - Breakout
This program models collision detection using a model of the game "Breakout". The purpose of this project was to both demonstrate the ability to create effective visual models and to show how collision detection can work in such a model.

## Unit 02 Project - Underwater Projectile Motion
This project explores the motion of projectiles underwater, showing the effects of buoyancy, gravity, and the magnus effect in tandem. It models the motion of a ball moving in and out of water and air, calculating different forces (such as drag, buoyancy, and gravity) and how they change when the ball moves between the two mediums.
