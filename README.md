# computational-modeling-blake-harrison
A collection of several projects showcasing several principles of physics.

Each project contains a jupyter notebook containing a description of the project, the underlying physical principles, and the results of the project.

## Semester Project - Baseball Pitch Visualization
This project provides a visualization of baseball pitches thrown in Major League Baseball games. It uses data provided by MLB's new pitch tracking software to creature a model of each pitch, by taking in factors such as starting velocity, spin axis, and rotational velocity of the baseball.

## Unit 00 Project - Breakout
This program models collision detection using a model of the game "Breakout". 

## Unit 02 Project - Underwater Projectile Motion
This project explores the motion of projectiles underwater, showing the effects of buoyancy, gravity, and the magnus effect in tandem.
