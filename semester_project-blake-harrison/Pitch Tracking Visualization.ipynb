    "# PITCH TRACKING VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE\n",
    "by Blake Harrison\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to provide a visualization of pitches thrown in Major League Baseball games. The program takes in data from MLB's [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search) website. This website can be used to download CSV data files that contain all the necessary metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of demonstration, this repository contains data files from three major league pitchers: Clayton Kershaw, of the Los Angeles Dodgers (kershaw_data.csv), Kenta Maeda, of the Minnesota Twins (maeda_data.csv), and Aroldis Chapman, of the New York Yankees (chapman_data.csv)."

    "## Physics\n",
    "The data gives us several key pieces of information about each pitch. We can turn that information into a visualization of the pitch in motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get, from the data:\n",
    "- The position of the pitch (x, y, and z) when the pitcher releases it\n",
    "- The velocity of the pitch (in the x-, y- and z-directions) when the pitcher releases it\n",
    "- The spin axis (in degrees)\n",
    "- The spin rate at release (in rpm)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate system used by this data is different than what we would normally expect, however.\n",
    "The back left corner of home plate is the origin (0,0).\n",
    "The positive x-direction is to the catcher's right.\n",
    "The positive y-direction is from home plate towards second base.\n",
    "The positive z-direction is upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin axis represents degrees in the 2D X-Z plane, such that 180 degrees represents pure topspin, and 0 degrees represents pure backspin. We can also assert that 90 degrees is clockwise sidespin (from the catcher's perspective) and 270 degrees is counterclockwise sidespin (also from the catcher's perspective).\n",
    "\n",
    "To break our spin into x- and z- components, we can use trigonometry. With an axis $\\theta$, our x-component will be $sin(\\theta)$, and our z-component will be $cos(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magnus Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnus effect describes the force on the ball by the air as a result of the ball's spin. That is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{magnus} = \\alpha \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin parameter is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{r\\omega}{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnus force is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{magnus} = \\frac{1}{2}C_L \\frac{\\rho A r}{S} \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The lift coefficient $C_L$ depends on the spin factor and is determined by a curve fit to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_L = 0.62S^{0.7}$$\n"

    "## Data Set 2: Kenta Maeda, 04/01/21\n",
    "This first data set uses pitch data from Minnesota Pitcher Kenta Maeda. This game was against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set shows his first eight pitches of the game. Instead of removing each pitch after it finishes, it remains on the visualization, allowing us to see the spread of these pitches compared to each other, and the path each one traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also interesting to note that the starting position for each pitch is slightly different. This is as expected - every pitcher is going to release pitches in more or less the same area, but the exact timing and position is almost impossible to duplicate between pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note of interest is that the pitches in this data set start on the left side of the plate (as opposed to the right of the previous data set). This again shows us that the starting positions are accurate, as Maeda throws right-handed while Kershaw (in the previous set) is left-handed."

    "## Validation\n",
    "I was able to validate most of the results of this project using baseball savant's [3D pitch visualization](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/visuals/pitch3d?player_id=477132#v=1&mainView=tracking&pov=umpire&hitterSide=all&marks=none&plays1=all&plays2=all). This showed me what most of the pitches actually looked like, so it was a solid metric to compare my results against.\n",

    "## Shortcomings\n",
    "This model is not perfect. One of the biggest reasons why is that it assumes that the baseball is perfectly spherical, which is not actually the case. Baseballs have seams running along them that often have a large effect on the motion of a baseball. \n",

    "For example, a knuckleball is a pitch that this program wil have trouble handling. When a pitcher throws a knuckleball, they attempt to put as little spin on the baseball as possible. As a result, the pitch moves extremely erratically, as the drag caused by the seams are the driving force behind the pitch's motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, some pitches, especially those that break hard and late (that curve sharply when they are near to home plate) do not always have as much motion as they should. This is likely due to the time step assumed by the program; rather than having the baseball follow a smooth trajectory, it actually moves it in small jumps that are small enough as to seem fluid to the human eye when run through the simulation. As a result, it is not a perfect representation of the baseball's motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decreasing the time step would be possible to give a more accurate trajectory, however, doing so makes the program run significantly slower. The current time step strikes a good balance between runtime and accuracy.\n"
